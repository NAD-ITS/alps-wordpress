One of his slaves, an Israelite, suggested that he go to Samaria, where the prophet Elisha would be able to heal him.</p><p>Elisha told Naaman to go wash himself in the river Jordan, and to immerse himself seven times if he wanted to be healed. Naaman was insulted. That river was muddy and it was unacceptable for a high official to bath in it.</p>"
